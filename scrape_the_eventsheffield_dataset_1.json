A new exhibition at Graves Gallery will bring together a number of rarely-seen works to showcase the group\u2019s considerable impact on the development of black British art.At a time when the Conservative government was outspokenly anti-immigrant, the British National Party was on the rise and the Brixton riots were shaking London, the Blk Art Group emerged as a creative force in Britain. The collective, formerly known as the Pan-Afrikan Connection, was establish by Eddie Chambers, Claudette Johnson, Keith Piper, Donald Rodney and Marlene Smith, who each made powerful responses to the crises in race relations both at home and overseas. A critical catalyst in raising the profile of black art in the UK, the Blk Art Group has influenced a generation of British artists, including Chris Ofili and Steve McQueen. The Blk Art Group will feature significant a number of large-scale works by Eddie Chambers, Donald Rodney and Keith Piper which were acquired for Sheffield during the 1980s. The exhibition will see Chambers\u2019 How Much Longer (1984), Piper\u2019s Black Assassin Saints (1984) and work from Rodney\u2019s Britannia Hospital (1988) series shown together for the first time in over 20 years. The Blk Art Group will also include Rodney\u2019s installation The House That Jack Built (1987), and acknowledge the importance of the work of both Claudette Johnson and Marlene Smith.In addition, the exhibition will explore the important role that regional galleries, including those in Sheffield, played in supporting and promoting black British art at a time when many public art institutions were reluctant to engage with the political subject matter\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPricesFree entry\r\nFree entry\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Sat 27 Aug 2011 - Sat 4 Feb 2012 \r\n           \r\n        Notes\r\n          Wednesday \u2013 Friday, 10am \u2013 2pm, Saturday 11am \u2013 3pm\r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

The Other Side was filmed on the Pavillion\u2019s upper landing, looking out across the exterior balcony to the sea and horizon. The installation features footage of elderly couples slowly waltzing against the setting sun coupled with Franz Schubert\u2019s Nocturne in E-flat Major (Op.148), interwoven with the noise of gulls and crashing waves. The film\u2019s rhythmic imagery combines with the plaintive, dramatic soundtrack to create a romantic, melancholy reflection on life and mortality. The exhibition will also include several films exploring Breakwell\u2019s work, including the BBC documentary The Continuous Diary (1977) and the BFI film, The FRAME (2007), made shortly before the artist\u2019s death.Ian Breakwell established an impressive international reputation throughout the second half of the 20th century for his multi-media work, which spanned everything from painting and photography to film and collage. Hugely prolific, he became known for his detached observations of modern society, most famously chronicled in a series of diaries which were subsequently adapted for Channel 4 television and screened during the 1980s. His work is represented in various national and international collections, including those of Tate, V&A, the National Portrait Gallery and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Ian Breakwell: The Other Side forms part of Art in Yorkshire \u2013 supported by Tate, a year long celebration of the visual arts in 19 galleries throughout Yorkshire in 2011. Works from Tate's Collection of historic, modern and contemporary art will be showcased through a compelling programme of exhibitions and events.Open Monday-Saturday 10am-5pm, Sunday 11am-4pm.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPricesFree entry\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Thu 6 Oct 2011 - Mon 2 Jan 2012 \r\n          10:00 to 17:00 \r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

I found his nostalgia for the certainties of his privileged upbringing quite sinister really. It reminded me of an Enid Blyton story. I thought if I\u2019m going to witness his Big Society, he can see mine as well. So I sent a copy [of The Big Society book] to No 10 Downing St, for his attention.\u201dThe Big Society was exhibited at FACT in Liverpool earlier this year, as part of the Look11 International Photography Festival. The Bank Street Arts show will feature a number of previously unseen photographs.Bank Street Arts will be hosting a number of other events and activities around this important exhibition (full details will be announced soon) and they urge anyone interested to come along and get involved.

        "details_text": "Since their formation in London in 1976, the members of Wire have maintained and advanced a musical project which treats the creative potential of a rock band as a fluid, amorphous medium. As removed from self-conscious intellectualism as they are from the inherent conservatism of much rock music, Wire employ their unique, endlessly restless and risk-taking creativity to question every aspect of song-writing, recording and performance. They delight and disturb in equal measure, troubleshooting the circuitry of perfect pop, or patrolling the limits of focused experimentalism. In terms of working together as Wire, the group's members disbanded in 1980, reformed in 1985, disbanded in 1992 and reformed for the second time in 2000. Such sabbaticals from their career as Wire have served to sharpen the group's edge and focus, updating the tactics with which they pursue this shared project.Wire came to prominence through the cultural revolution of punk in the UK, the effects of which were felt throughout the latter half of the 1970s. Immediately fluent in the language of contrariness and paradox, Wire's very name was industrial and poetic, blank and eerie. As evidenced by their two tracks on the compilation released in August 1977, The Roxy London WC2 Jan\u2013Apr 77 (the brooding Lowdown and the instantly iconic, neurasthenic mini-drama 12XU) the group made a musical virtue of tension and a lyrical strength of ambiguity.More than any other group from that period, Wire embraced the purpose of punk as a minting of otherness and newness\u2014as a response to the notion of modernity itself reaching critical mass. From a seamless fusion of contradictions (fast and slow, funny and menacing, soft and loud, gentle and angry, clever and dumb) the group created a singularity of sound and attitude which was utterly distinctive, precision channelled as though to concentrate its energy through highly sophisticated modes of constriction.This proactive use of constriction could be said to begin with the group's stripped-down instrumentation: two guitars, vocal and drums, as though the mechanics of Wire's engine were race-tuned to reach the sheer speed required by many of the songs. Musically and lyrically, repetition, abbreviation, tempo and acceleration have become a constant in Wire's career-long processes of self-reinvention. 'Monophonic and monorhythmic'- to quote their own description of their epic track, Drill released in 1986.With regard to performance, Wire exchanged the traditional heroics of live rock for the rhetoric of incitement, while remaining irresistibly entertaining. Two specific performances, within their usual run of concerts, defined the group's determination to maintain newness by confounding audience expectations. The concert known and recorded as Document and Eyewitness took place at the Electric Ballroom, Camden Town on 29th February 1980. While a significant faction of the capacity audience was made up of drunk skinheads baying for Wire speed hits such as 12XU, the group delivered a set of fragmented performance pieces, including masked people wearing paper headdresses, the hitting of a gas cooker with hammers, and the frequent appearance of a track-suited compere whose banter with the crowd ranged from jovial to threatening. These interventions were punctuated by teasing, recognisable fragments of Wire's better known music, the result being a gradually increasing tension between audience and performers which, at that time in such a venue, was genuinely dangerous.A previous performance at the Jeanetta Cochrane Theatre, Southampton Row, had included a chorus of anonymous guitarists and an on-stage action painting. Afterwards, the performance continued acoustically in the foyer and eventually morphed into discourse with the audience. Both concerts, vitally, brought the ethos of an art happening such as Gustav Metzger's Symposium of Auto- Destructive Art, from July 1961 (which included the making of a painting with hydrochloric acid on nylon) to a primarily non art-specialist audience of music fans.Such risk-taking and creative self-scrutiny was continued by Wire\u2019s performance, flag:burning, held at the Barbican Centre, London in June 2003. Created in collaboration with the artists Jake and Dinos Chapman, and the designer ES Devlin, \u2018flag:burning\u2019 was entirely within Wire's mission to renew their creativity and their identity through disruption, disturbance and explorations of other media. The first half of the concert presented a performance of Wire's debut album, the legendary Pink Flag (first released in November 1977), played in its entirety. The second\u2014aiming to 'erase' this celebration of Pink Flag's iconic status\u2014was a performance of Wire\u2019s then new release, \u2018send\u2019.Pink Flag had defined Wire as a group so taut that their slightest inflection\u2014the pulse of a guitar line, the pared-down percussion of bass drum, snare and hi-hat, the range of Colin Newman's vocal from football terrace shout to jaunty, barrow-boy absurdism\u2014achieved an amplification little short of monolithic. flag:burning confronted the right of such a monolith to even exist\u2014thus summarising the group\u2019s career-long triumph as musicians and performers who have turned enquiry into an art-form, balancing intensity and ambiguity, and never allowing either to fall.Wire has continually made a creative virtue of the various periods during which they have not worked together as a band. Pursuing various solo projects and taking time apart has ensured that when Wire reconvenes it is always with the impetus of renewed dynamics and artistic freshness.The resignation of founder member Bruce Gilbert in 2004 allowed the group a similar pause for thought and reconfiguration. If Wire is regarded as a model for making contemporary music, how might that model be realigned in the wake of such a significant change of personnel?The answer to this question, in a manner well-suited to Wire's career-long ability to simultaneously create the group's future while curating its past, would arrive in the form of elegantly produced re-issues of Wire's iconic recordings from the 1970s, and the continuation in earnest on the new material that would comprise Read and Burn 3 (2007) and Object 47 (2008). Bruce Gilbert had been involved in the initial work on the tracks for the former, while the latter was made without his involvement. Both records would be an advance and consolidation of Wire's stylistic eclecticism and sheer musical force. Object 47, the group's first release as a three piece, found Wire at their most fluid and elliptical, reprising and enhancing the beguiling forces to be heard on 154 and IBTABA.A period of live performances followed, featuring guest guitarists Margaret Fiedler-McGinnis and latterly Matt Sims. This touring schedule was accompanied by a re-issue of the long unavailable Send (2003/2010) and the inauguration of the Legal Bootleg Series, with a DVD recording of Wire's razor sharp performance on 21st July, 1985, at the Bloomsbury Theatre, London \u2013 a time in the group's history marked by the instant classic single Our Swimmer and the monolithic Drill. Once again, the curatorial aspect of Wire's on-going definition of itself is pronounced: in the mid-1980s the group had re-emerged to tumultuous acclaim from a sabbatical during which they shed the dead tissue of punk and post-punk, and solidified their identity as a creative unit that could be seen as both contemporary art project and working band. 2008 would also see the publication of Wilson Neate's assiduously researched and scholarly appraisal on Wire's debut album, Pink Flag, published in the 33&#8531; series by Continuum.Balancing history, however, is renewed creativity in the form of the evocatively titled Red Barked Tree, recorded in London during 2010 and composed by the pared down line-up Lewis, Newman and Grey. A bravura soundscape that is as lyrical as it is densely urban, and as plangent as it is futuristic, Red Barked Tree endorsed Newman's astute observation: \"It's Wire unleashed. Wire always manage to sound like Wire, even though there's no actual brief that says what Wire are supposed to sound like. That's a key element in how it all works.\" Michael BracewellWith support from Talk Normal.Over 14s only.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPrices\u00a314.00 (booking fees may apply)\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Sat 3 Dec 2011 \r\n          19:00 \r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

The inaugural \u201cQuoFest\u201d tour sees the mighty Status Quo joined on all dates by Roy Wood and Kim Wilde.  This killer line-up is not to be missed and is sure to be the ultimate musical Christmas party.    Status Quo themselves need no introduction: more hit singles than any other band, more hit albums than The Beatles, more appearances on Top Of The Pops than any other act; the superlatives keep coming.Roy Wood is one of the UK\u2019s most treasured songwriters; he created hits for The Move, ELO and of course Wizzard [a certain Christmas track among them].Kim Wilde became an instant new wave phenomenon in the \u201980s and was ever present in the charts with smashes like \u201cYou Came\u201d, \u201cYou Keep Me Hangin\u2019 On\u201d and of course the smash \u201cKids In America\u201d.  Incredibly, between them this trio has released around 170 chart singles.Status Quo\u2019s latest studio album \u201cQuid Pro Quo\u201d is released 30 May 2011 exclusively through Tesco and comes bundled with a second disc the \u201cOfficial Bootleg \u2013 Greatest Hits Live\u201d that captures the power of a Quo gig.The Status Quo \u201cQuoFest\u201d set will feature the first airings of some of the new material but of course the band will blast out a slew of massive hits from that amazing catalogue of classics.  Add into that the legendary hit-machine Roy Wood and a host of hits from Kim Wilde and \u201cQuoFest\u201d represents an evening of over 3 hours of entertainment that would put a smile on even Ebeneezer Scrooge\u2019s face.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPrices\u00a337.50\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Sun 4 Dec 2011 \r\n          19:00 \r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

Dimitris Sideris focuses on the Cretan lute and extends its technique by adapting elements from related string instruments. John Papatzanis extends the technical capabilities of the ancient Cretan daouli as well as incorporating other traditional percussions (Persian tombak, Indian udu-ghatam, Middle Eastern frame drums).Motivated by their common love and respect for Cretan music, they have created a world music trio and they endeavour to develop an alternative sound style.

This unique documentary combines video and time-lapse photography to chart the changes in the stunning 360 perfect horizon but also the effect of solitude and empty space on his mood.The film won over 12 international awards including the Golden Frog for Best Cinematography at the CameraImage Film Festival, the International Documentary Association's Best Documentary Short and a Jury Prize at Silverdocs/AFI.

Schoenberg\u2019s second String Quartet features the precise moment when the composer diverted the course of classical music from lush and romantic tonality to atonal music. The final two movements uniquely feature a soprano, with words from Stefan George\u2019s poem Rapture. Brahms was a big influence on Schoenberg and you can hear this in his Piano Quartet in A, which reveals just how forward-looking the supposedly conservative Brahms really was.Pre-concert Talk, 6.45pm: Ensemble 360 members Tim and Judith discuss Schoenberg\u2019s path to atonality; choice or necessity?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPrices\u00a315.00 Adult\u00a310.00 Concessions\u00a33.00 Under 18s & Students\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Thu 8 Dec 2011 \r\n          19:45 to 00:00 00:00 to 00:00 \r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

Blacc famously wrote I Need A Dollar following a redundancy from his then-job, during which he still gigged furiously as an MC, searching for a break. Dollar began to pick up extensive attention following its use on the HBO show, \u2018How to Make It in America\u2019, before impacting across Europe and the US, almost via word-of-mouth. Its release through Epic in May eventually led to an extraordinary eight weeks in the UK Top 10, where it peaked at number 2. The track is already nearing 400,000 sales in the UK, has picked up over 13 million Youtube hits for the official video, and was recently nominated for a Mojo Award for Best Song. With a Top 10 album, Good Things, also under his belt, Blacc has now emerged as one of the year\u2019s most in-demand new artists.

On the way, we learn of Oersted's experiments showing that electric currents make magnets and Faraday's wonderful discovery of electromagnetic induction that led to electric generators and the National Grid.Ably assisted by the pupils of Curbar Primary School, many experiments and demonstrations, a bicycle generator, a cake making microwave oven, lengths of steel rod tied into knots, a Jacob's ladder and some 150,000 Volt sparks, Mike Diprose and Mick Proctor will show some of the 'Magic of Magnetism'.This free lecture is aimed at a family audience.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPricesFree entry\r\nPlaces can be booked by emailing cse@shu.ac.uk.\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Fri 9 Dec 2011 \r\n          19:00 \r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

For all of us in OMA, nothing matches the thrill of being out on the road, performing live and meeting all our fabulous loyal supporters. Our Christmas tour last year was such great fun and we can't wait to get back out there doing what we love to do the most!\"The group are unafraid to tackle music not normally associated with male voice choirs, their repertoire ranges from the 17th Century to the present day, and has included several world premieres in this time. In 2008, Only Men Aloud entered what was to be the UK\u2019s biggest choir competition to date, with choirs battling to become voted the best choir in the UK on BBC One\u2019s hit Saturday night show Last Choir Standing. In October that year Only Men Aloud signed a five album, multi-million pound record deal with Universal Classics and Jazz, and joined Merlin Elite's management roster.The choir's top-twenty debut album was recorded over five days at AIR studios in London, and achieved gold status within the first week of sales they went on to sell over a quarter million albums within the UK. The choir appears regularly on network radio and television. Notable broadcasts include the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium, Radio Three Choir of the Year from The Royal Festival Hall, and a performance on HMS Belfast for the BBC One New Years Eve broadcast.In 2009, the boys completed two successful trips to the United States, a critically acclaimed sell out tour of the United Kingdom recorded their second album Band Of Brothers in Cardiff with the BBC National Orchestra of Wales which was released October 12thand stayed at number 1 in the classical charts for a number of weeks. They performed for Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace and completed a second sold out UK tour in December 2009.

        "details_text": "Operation Crucible, over the nights of 11th/12th and 15th December 1940, was the attempt by Hitler\u2019s Luftwaffe  to deal a fatal blow to Sheffield\u2019s vital role in the British war effort and to do to the city what it had done to Coventry. Nine hours of continuous aerial bombardment laid waste large parts of the city centre and this is still reflected in the cityscape to this day. The raiders returned on the 15th December but most of the forges, steelworks and industrial plant of the city escaped unscathed. The centre of Sheffield burnt with a glow that was seen for miles around, much damage was done to Sheffielders homes and hundreds of the cities inhabitants perished. Incredible heroism was shown, much of it unrecorded amidst tragedy such as the direct hit on the Marples public house and the laying waste of most of the Moor. Many anecdotes and tales will be told on the night and flowers will be laid on the site of the Marples public house. Follow the events of Operation Crucible with a guided and illustrated walk with Professional Sheffielder, Local Historian And Author Ron Clayton.

It\u2019s taken us a minute to clear dates in all of these venues, as this is obviously an incredibly busy time of year, but finally we\u2019ve been able to make it work and cannot wait to get there!\"Customers who hold tickets for the original show date in Sheffield of the 4th June should keep hold of these tickets as they are still valid for the new date. Anyone who purchased tickets through the Arena Box Office is being contacted in writing about the changes, should you have any further questions call the Motorpoint arena on 0114 256 5656.Tickets priced \u00a355, \u00a340, & \u00a330 (subject to booking fee) are on sale now. To book call 0114 256 5656, visit www.motorpointarena.co.uk or call in person at the Motorpoint Arena. Duran Duran\u2019s stunning new album: \u201cAll You Need Is Now\u201d, has already been proclaimed a triumph by fans and critics alike, as buzz continues to build towards the release of the full length record in March.  Produced by Grammy Award-winner Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse, Adele, Kaiser Chiefs, Lily Allen) and mixed by Spike Stent (Madonna, Bj\u00f6rk, No Doubt), it features guest vocals/rap from long time Duran Duran pal/collaborator Ana Matronic of the Scissor Sisters and R&B/neo-soul superstar Kelis; while Owen Pallett of Arcade Fire contributes the album\u2019s string arrangements. \u201cAll You Need Is Now\u201d is a return-to-roots homage to Duran Duran\u2019s most celebrated musical panache, which has already been dubbed by its producer as the \u201cimaginary follow up to Rio that never was.\u201d Throughout their outstanding career Duran Duran has sold more than 80 million records, with 30 chart toppers in the UK, 18 American hit singles and a global presence that guarantees them huge concert audiences on five continents. Now a seemingly unstoppable force, with no fewer than five prestigious Lifetime Achievement Awards under their belts in the last few years alone (MTV Video Music Awards, the Brit Awards, the Ivor Novellos, Q Magazine and the Spanish Ondas), the four original members of Duran Duran are in a category with only a handful of other internationally acclaimed artists. As this new chapter begins, they have nothing left to prove, but everything to play for.  So for them and their loyal army of fans...

After a sell-out tour earlier this year and with the highly anticipated release of their new album this autumn, Frankie, Mollie, Una, Vanessa and Rochelle have announced their biggest tour to date, a massive 11 date arena tour. The tour will see them playing at some of the biggest indoor venues the in UK this December. With all of this in mind, it\u2019s clear that while The Saturdays were \u2018big\u2019 before, they are about to get \u2018huge\u2019. \"The thought that we are about to take on arenas sends a shiver down my spine,\" Rochelle comments, \"it's everything we've ever dreamed of as a band and we know the end of the year is going to come around so fast. Playing an arena is a terrifying, but most exciting thought!\" The girls already know that they\u2019ll be performing material from their forthcoming and as yet unnamed, album. Although they do say the fabulously bold and edgy first single \u201cNotorious\u201d is a good indication of what\u2019s to come, a tougher, edgier sound. \u201cIt\u2019s very current,\u201d says Una. \u201cWe still have our pop edge, but this time around we've taken things a bit more dance-y.\" Frankie adds: \"And we want to reflect that in our live show. We want it to be like one big giant party. The best night out you can have this December!\"  Undoubtedly, the UK\u2019s biggest and most consistently high-hitting girl band, with over 650,000 Facebook fans and a combined 1 million followers on twitter, The Saturdays have sold over 2 million singles and albums in the UK alone.  The Saturdays have also had nine Top 10 UK singles, including huge hits \u201cHigher\u201d featuring Flo Rida, \u201cMissing You\u201d and \u201cEgo\u201d, the girls have racked up over 35 million total views on YouTube.Tickets will be posted out no earlier than a month prior to the show.

It\u2019s all the creation of Wilda Goyetche (or \u2018Wildago\u2019 for short), a Canadian artist who now lives and works in Sheffield.Wildago\u2019s work is charming, colourful and fun, but what makes her paintings really special is how you find yourself\u2013without even realising it\u2013being drawn into her imaginary world.\u2018It was always my intention to create characters people would warm to,\u2019 explains Wilda, \u2018but the way the whole thing\u2019s taken off is simply incredible!\u2019Over the past couple of years Wildago\u2019s fan base hasn\u2019t just grown- it\u2019s gone global. Friends and collectors from all over the world keep in touch with the artist through the Wildago website, Facebook page and Twitter. There is even a rip-roaring blog, \u2018written\u2019 by intrepid newshound Todd-the-Dog.\u2018What makes it so exciting for me is that the Painted World of Wildago has developed into a two-way relationship,\u2019 adds the artist. \u2018People seem to like suggesting storylines and ideas, sending me fashion tips for Pearl and generally keeping me on my toes!\u2019But you don\u2019t have to be living in New York, Tokyo or Buenos Aires to sample the magic of Wildago, because on Monday, 19th December Pearl and her friends are coming up to Totley for a Christmas Party!Everyone is warmly invited to the Cross Scythes to Kiss Miss Pearl!

In 2011 he recorded his first solo album, 'What Remains Of The Day' and published yet another book, titled 'Reeling in the Years', detailing the soundtrack to his half century on God's good earth. The biopic must surely now be an inevitability.He's also been doing some solo shows (with his multi-instrumentalist fellow Mahone, Chris Lee), featuring acoustic songs and stories from said solo album and latest book, and we're delighted to say that he and Chris have agreed to do a one-off, Bright Phoebus special, to see in 2012 in inimitable style.Questions, and indeed drinks, from the audience welcome.Get your tickets soon because this will be a hugely popular and thoroughly entertaining night out!With support from the lovely singing of Sheffield's very own, Kirsty Bromley and MC'd by the great, Martin Simpson - this is going to be one FABULOUS night!\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPrices\u00a310.00Tickets are available from the venue an online at http://www.wegottickets.com/event/123422\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Sat 14 Jan 2012 \r\n          20:00 \r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

        "details_text": "Brooklyn native Rebecca Pronsky is one of New York City's finest singers and songwriters and she's back through the UK sharing a new crop of her dark country-tinged gems.  Her latest album \"Viewfinder\" has received loads of accolades both stateside and in the UK.  R2 gave it 4 stars saying she's \"head and shoulders above most of her contemporaries, an outstanding lyricist with the ability to stop you in your tracks.\"  The Scotsman praises her \"crystal-bright yet earthily sensuous voice and melodically alluring songcraft\" and Americana UK declares \"She is ready to take us by storm over here.\"  Rebecca is joined on tour by collaborator and twangy lead guitarist Rich Bennett.  The duo has shared stages with Josh Ritter, Steve Forbert, Carrie Rodriguez, Patty Larkin, Shawn Colvin, and Loudon Wainwright III, among others.  Hear more at http://www.rebeccapronsky.com Some press quotes:\"(4 STARS) Pronsky's performance stands head and shoulders above most of her contemporaries, especially in combination with her superlative writing skills. Pretty close to perfection, 'Viewfinder' reveals Pronsky to be an outstanding lyricist with the ability to stop you in your tracks.\"~ R2 (Rock n Reel) UK\"Pronsky is an allusive, poetic lyricist who isn't interested in providing clear, linear meanings so much as impressions, dreams, and moods.\" ~ All Music Guide\"( 8/10 ) Keeps that yearning sound of love and loss burning strong.  Along with Pronsky's pipes, guitarist Rich Bennett puts the trimmings on the music with a battery of echo drenched, twangy leads. Viewfinder has her poised to take off...\"~ Blurt\"Classy without abandoning a certain twang that sounds more retro than redneck.\"~ Creative Loafing (Charlotte, NC)\"Brooklyn singer/songwriter Rebecca Pronsky shuffles through the dark territory where old-fashioned rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, country, and folk come together. It\u2019s roughly the same territory where Neko Case operates, and any accusations of carpetbagging are shot down by both the conviction of her songs and the strength of her voice.\"      ~ Metro Pulse (Knoxville, TN)Little Robotshttp://mylittlerobots.co.uk/  \"First there was a bang. Then there was clang and then all of a sudden, out of the smoke, 3 little robots appeared.\" There are more than 3 of them and nothing robotic about their playing. The sounds of Appalachia via Sheffield, London and Newcastle ring out from the right side of the Seven Hills and beyond. This tight knit collective utilize traditional instrumentation such as banjo, ukulele and violin and employ close vocal harmonies to draw the audience into their love of folk and blues. The Early Days Little Robots came from the brain of Laura Little in about 2004 when she was making little robots at art school in London. After Laura asked Jonny Kearney and Lucy Farrell to be little robots with her, 2009 saw their first gig in and the Little Robots collective was born. Now! Now settled into their proverbial slippers Little Robots areLaura Little (vocals and ukulele),Mary Booth (vocals, ukulele and bass),Ric Booth (guitar, banjo, violin and vocals),Dolly May (vocals, round bell, melodica and ukulele) andGuy Whittaker (percussion and vocals). \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPrices\u00a34.00 advance\u00a35.00 on door\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Thu 26 Jan 2012 \r\n          19:30 to 23:45 \r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

        "details_text": "James Vincent McMorrow\u2019s musical life began far removed from the haunting folk and mythic imagery of his debut output. His early love was hardcore rock, and he spent his teens learning to play drums to the likes of Refused, At The Drive In and Glassjaw. It wasn\u2019t until he heard Donny Hathaway\u2019s \u2018I Love You More Than You Will Ever Know\u2019 that he even considered singing, and because of the high, soulful tone to his voice, James found particular encouragement from female singer/songwriters. \u201cI can understand the way they construct melody almost better than I can the way male singers write,\u201d James notes. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t until about four years ago that I actually wrote my first song. I knew I needed to have things worth talking about before I put pen to paper.\u201d\u2018Early In The Morning\u2019, then, is the result of a self-education, and the time James spent learning his craft. Having begun to write songs, he quickly sought somewhat surprising inspiration in the hip hop production of acts such as The Neptunes and Timbaland. James then spent three years experimenting with sounds and learning how to make music, and only then did he take this newfound knowledge into an isolated house by the Irish Sea, intent on making a record. One of the first fruits of this six-month labour was \u2018If I Had A Boat\u2019: an eerie and emotive introduction to the album, which began life as just a title, but soon started to marry an array of influences. Throughout the record, you can hear the overtones of his Irish upbringing brought together with these traditionally more American, West Coast sounds (see also the relentless \u2018Sparrow & The Wolf\u2019, or the instantly-catchy \u2018This Old Dark Machine\u2019).As an album, \u2018Early In The Morning\u2019 is an atmospheric and absorbing listen, which peels back layers upon every visit. It can be musically sweet and lyrically maudlin by equal measure (note the \u201cyou can stop your crying, I\u2019m never coming back\u201d opening to the relatively upbeat \u2018Breaking Hearts\u2019). The unusual influence of those great female singers also makes an emotional mark (\u2018We Don\u2019t Eat\u2019 wouldn\u2019t feel out of place on a Billie Holiday collection). And though the album\u2019s conception will inevitably draw comparisons with Bon Iver and his cabin, the record bears closer inspiration from the likes of John Steinbeck, F Scott Fitzgerald or Roald Dahl: writers who examined, in McMorrow\u2019s words, \u201cthe darker, less spoken about aspects of life, solitude and disillusionment. The characters I create in those songs, the ones existing in the shadows...they\u2019re all elements of me, for sure.\u201d This is perhaps best demonstrated on \u2018From The Woods!!\u2019 towards the record\u2019s end, which builds, fades and then positively erupts into a dramatic musical conclusion. The album closes just as it started, on the bucolic five-part harmony of \u2018Early In The Morning, I\u2019ll Come Calling\u2019.James Vincent McMorrow has taken a somewhat circuitous route to success (hardcore rock, hip hop, a house by the Irish Sea and a growing love of folk). Yet he has emerged as a quite brilliant new talent.New Single: \u2018We Don\u2019t Eat\u2019 / \u2018Higher Love\u2019 out November 13October UK Tour and Royal Festival Hall Date Also Confirmed\u201cSounds both fresh and as if they\u2019ve been in your head forever\u2026McMorrow\u2019s debut deserves its success\u201d Q, ****\"The Irish songsmith's haunting, soulful sound blossoms....he will be unstoppable\" Guardian ****\u201cVocals, lyrics and arrangements whose restraint and subtlety are totally at odds with the profound impact and resonance of his songs\u2019 Sunday Times Culture\u201cDusky vignettes on unseen and wondrous magic\u2026gorgeous\u201d NME\u201cA captivating debut\u2026An arresting journey from emotional trials to aural pleasure\u201d Uncut, ****\u201cHis high, hoarse timbre is used to magnificent effect\u201d Mojo, ****Dublin\u2019s James Vincent McMorrow will release a new single, \u2018We Don\u2019t Eat\u2019, on November 13. This latest track to be lifted from James\u2019 debut album \u2013 \u2018Early In the Morning\u2019 \u2013 will be backed by a gorgeous cover of Steve Winwood\u2019s \u2018Higher Love\u2019, which has already reached #1 on Hype Machine, and will be available as a limited edition 7\u201d via Rough Trade. With an October tour and more live plans for the winter TBA, McMorrow can also confirm a Royal Festival Hall headline show for February 2012.\u2018We Don\u2019t Eat\u2019 is a strange and quietly emotive highlight from James Vincent McMorrow\u2019s debut record, which was released in the UK this March. Having received significant acclaim, it has become a genuinely self-made success story. With playlist support strong across Radio 1, Radio 2 and XFM, James has also supported the likes of Joanna Newsom and Arcade Fire, as well as selling out headline shows at London\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Hall, ICA and St Pancras Church. Then followed extensive touring across the US, together with major UK festivals (Glastonbury, Latitude, Bestival, Green Man). In his native Ireland, meanwhile, James\u2019 record has already gone Gold, been nominated for the prestigious Choice Prize \u2013 the Irish Mercury \u2013 and will see him return to Dublin this autumn, where he\u2019ll play two long-sold-out shows at the Olympia.All this is far removed from the slow-but-steady route James Vincent McMorrow took when making music. Having begun his career drumming in hardcore bands, James dropped out of college and spent his teens laboriously teaching himself how to sing and write songs: four years were dedicated to simply learning his craft, whilst making ends meet pushing trolleys at an airport. He then signed to EMI Publishing in 2008, moving from Dublin to London intent on making a record. However, feeling stifled by studios and still unhappy with his material, James returned home to Ireland with his tail firmly between his legs.Seizing the chance to finally make music on his own, McMorrow accepted the offer of a six-month stint in an isolated house by the Irish Sea. Here, his songwriting finally flourished. An album quickly emerged inspired by everything from Donny Hathaway - James\u2019 high, soulful voice led to him being asked to sing with the girls in the school choir - to the dark, turn-of-the-century narratives of John Steinbeck and F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is a mix that \u2018We Don\u2019t Eat\u2019 exemplifies, with its somewhat mythic imagery (\u201ctwo thousand years I\u2019ve been in that water / two thousand years, sunk like a stone\u201d) contrasting effectively with James\u2019 rich and uplifting voice. McMorrow\u2019s pursuit of perfectionism was worth the wait.Over 14s only.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPrices\u00a312.50 (booking fees may apply)\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Fri 10 Feb 2012 \r\n           \r\n        Notes\r\n          Doors open at 7pm.\r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

        "details_text": "After 20 years, ten studio albums, five greatest hits compilations, thirty-four chart singles, 15 million record sales worldwide and performing in front of millions of fans, when time was called on The Beautiful South in 2008, not everyone was ready to leave the party. Dave Hemingway and Ali Wheeler, lead singers with the band - along with departed songwriter Paul Heaton \u2013 were having too much fun to get out the pipe and slippers, and so The South was formed. Joining the duo were fellow mainstays from the original band: keyboard wizard Damon Butcher and the potent horn section of Gaz Birtles and Tony Robinson that brought so much to the live shows. Armed with a sensational back catalogue of hits such as \u2018Song For Whoever\u2019, \u2018Perfect Ten\u2019, \u2018Rotterdam\u2019, \u2018Don't Marry Her\u2019, \u2018You Keep It All In\u2019, \u2018Old Red Eyes Is Back\u2019 and many others, there is a long way to go on this particular road.This band has history and pedigree. Dave Hemingway\u2019s musical career stretches back into the Eighties. He became a founder member of The Beautiful South after the demise of The Housemartins, who had enjoyed a sustained purple patch and many hits before calling it a day in 1988. Whilst bassist Norman Cook went on to become superstar DJ Fat Boy Slim, Paul Heaton and Dave Hemingway proceeded to form the new band in December 1988. Right from the off, The Beautiful South seemed to defy the normal logic associated with pop bands, not least for the fact that they stayed together for 20 years.Over the life of the band, they produced many self-penned hits and had several number one albums \u2013 they scored their only number one single with the Dave Hemingway / Briana Corrigan duet \u2018A Little Time\u2019. A globally successful band, members of The South have performed these songs in front of hordes of fans from Hull to Houston. They love the material and know what will keep the fans happy.Now with The South marking the next step in these musicians\u2019 careers, the band are starting to add in exciting new songs to their repertoire. Competition for space in a set-list packed with so many hits is fierce, but the quality of some of the new material is such that the songs have slotted right in \u2013 and the fans\u2019 reaction has been amazing.The South certainly have history. But the future looks bright...\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPrices\u00a320.00 (booking fees may apply)\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Wed 15 Feb 2012 \r\n           \r\n        Notes\r\n          Doors open at 7pm.\r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

The group opens our Beethoven mini-festival with a fascinating quartet that seems to explore the agonising time at which Beethoven was first struggling with deafness. It features extreme contrasts, from exuberance and dizzying momentum to despair and, ultimately, joy.  The Harp Quartet is so called because of the pizzicato (plucking of strings) in the first movement. It was unusual at the time for this technique to have such prominence, and created a new palette for string writing.In partnership with The University of Sheffield Concert SeriesPre-concert Talk, 6.45pm: The QuartetsProfessor William Drabkin from The University of Southampton takes a closer look at the music being performed tonight.All pre-concert talks are free to concert ticket holders but you need a separate ticket.

The Thing About Rizzle Kicks is that they make it all look very easy.\"And, it's hard to disagree. At 19 years old, Harley Alexander-Sule and Jordan Stephens are two of the most exciting teenage talents to emerge in 2011. Friends since they were five, the duo combines an old skool hip-hop sound with a forward thinking pop mentality. Littering their lyrics with wry pop culture references and a sharp sense of humour, The Rizzles transcend the confines of hip-hop culture as both a credible and commercial act.Comparisons to De La Soul, The Pharcyde and a Tribe Called Quest are unsurprising considering their influences include many of the artists those Daisy Age acts sampled; Roy Ayers, Quincy Jones, Jimi Hendrix, Frank Sinatra, Stevie, James Brown and a wealth of 60s soul. As well as a nod to the old-skool, the boys also embrace everything from country, ska and hip-hop, to straight up pop chord progressions and incredibly, ridiculously catchy choruses. \"We've slaved to find a definition of our sound because it's more edgy than pop but its not pure hip hop either \u00ad it's somewhere in-between,\" ponders Harley. \"We used to say indie-hop but that sounds really lame!\"While their inspirations might occasionally be retrospective (but definitely never lame), their approach to making music is anything but. Brought up on the World Wide Web, Harley and Jordan maximized their YouTube channel to its full potential. Taking on the Internet as complete unknowns, the pair implemented a dynamic DIY approach, mashing up Lily Allen's \"The Fear\" witha beat blagged off Jakwob, freestyling with their friend Ed Sheeran, and creating a number of lo-fi videos for their early bootleg remixes.With all of their videos having been produced by friend Tony Lockerbie, there's a natural synergy and growth in both the development of the music and the visual element of their working partnership. Having shot both the original and most recent video for \"Down With The Trumpets\", Harley remembers how it all came together, Jordan won \u00a3500 in a rap competition a few years back and used the cash to buy a beat off Dag Nabbit (of Foreign Beggars). We did the track, but then kind of left it alone for a year until we were going through some old tunes and thought we should try and do something with it. Toby was our mate who had this amazing camera so we asked him if he'd direct a video, even though none of us really knew what we were doing, we thought we'd just see what happened.That video ended up being the main reason Island Records signed them at the start of the year, and it definitely paid off. Having released Trumpets' as their debut single in June, the pair sold over 250,000 copies this summer, hung around in the top 10 (#8) for 4 weeks and has notched up over 4.5 million views (and counting!).Their debut album 'Stereo Typical' will see them solidify much of the autonomous attitude that made them such a ubiquitous proposition in the first place. The progressive set-list of producers, which includes Norman Cook, The Rural (Beyonc\u00e9, Jamie T), Futurecut (Lily Allen) and Ant Whiting (M.I.A.) is as diverse and distinct as their sound. Norman Cook was soimpressed by the Rizzles that he made a very, very rare trip to the studio to create 'Mama Do The Hump'. \"We just stared like: 'Legend',\" laughs Jordan of working with Fatboy Slim. Another hero of theirs, Ali Shaheed from A Tribe Called Quest is also a fan. We had a chat with him on the phone. He said he liked our 'steeze'. The fact that he he'd heard our music and could see that we'd taken heed of what they did was amazing, says Harley.Playing at Jordan's auntie's house as little kids, Jordan was born in Willesden and Harley in Haringey. After losing contact around the age of 7, they were surprised to meet up again three years later, when it turned out that both of their parents had decided to move their families from London to Brighton. \"He'd probably say I'm a dickhead,\" laughs Jordan when asked how they'd describe each other. \"I love him to pieces,\" Harley interjects. \"He's about logic and irony, whereas I'm a bit illogical I suppose, but it doesbalance itself out somehow.\" After a brief spot at the Brit school (though they\u00b9re at pains to point out that rather than Music, Jordan studied Media and Harley Theatre), the Rizzle\u00b9s first booking was at the Underage Festival. This summer alone they\u00b9ve sold out both The Barfly and XOYO, supported both Dizzee Rascal and The Streets at Ibiza Rocks, headlined the BBC Introducing stage at Reading/Leeds festival and performed at T4 On The Beach amongst others.Having also featured on Olly Murs' number 1 single \"Heart Skips A Beat\" this summer and more recently been nominated for 3 MOBO Awards, the guys couldn't be in a better position to release their \"Stereo Typical\" LP at the end of this month. Although don't expect them to put their feet up once it's out, November marks the release of \"Teardrops\" this year's Children In Need single that they feature on and the start of their UK tour with Professor Green.Their album \"Stereo Typical\" is out 31st October, with next single \"When I Was A Youngster\" out the week before on 24th October. To carry on their collaboration with Tony Lockerbie, there will be a video made for every track on the LP.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPrices\u00a310.00 (booking fees may apply)\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Sat 18 Feb 2012 \r\n           \r\n        Notes\r\n          Doors open at 7pm.\r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

We just want everyone to come along and enjoy themselves, so don your \"The Wanted\" t-shirts and why not purchase a ticket-for-entry?  It'll be spiffing!\u201dThe Wanted boys burst into our lives and the charts last summer, with their incredible 2011 BRIT nominated debut single, All Time Low, storming straight into the number one spot. Followed by number two hit Heart Vacancy, they have quickly built up a huge fan base. Their self-titled debut album raced into the top five, and they have had over an incredible 30 million plays of their videos on YouTube. In March the boys were given the honour of releasing the official Comic Relief single for Red Nose Day. The single, Gold Forever, became their third top five single.Their latest number 1 single, Glad You Came, is the first from their hotly tipped second album. Written by Steve Mac, Wayne Hector and Ed Drewitt and produced by Steve Mac, this song brings a harder, club-influenced sound to the table for Jay, Max, Nathan, Siva and Tom. A dance floor filler, with a heavy bass line combined with the boy\u2019s rock vocals, this track will have you raving from London to Ibiza this summer. Earlier this year the boys performed their first headline tour which had rave reviews from the press with The Times, Evening Standard and News Of  The World giving the shows 4 stars.

        "details_text": "\"Most of my ideas are written at night\" explains SBTRKT. \"Late at night, when everything around is silent - that atmosphere is where most of this record came from, and for me it explains it's sound\"SBTRKT is no stranger to writing, recording and releasing music. To date he's had multiple releases on Brainmath, Numbers, Ramp, Monkeytown and now home label Young Turks. Add to that re-workings of Radiohead and Goldie, and remixes of Modeselektor... However, this is his first full length album. \"This release is the culmination of a longer period of constant writing and collaboration, tracks on previous EPs were written as singular pieces. This record is much more of a whole project, more representative of my thoughts and ideas as an artist and each track was completed with the aim to be coherent together.\"Like most of the most exciting music around today, the story starts from the sound system of Plastic People, an east London club both underground in location and in the music it specialises in. It was here that SBTRKT met Tic (a&r for Young Turks Records) and was schooled by the sounds that came pulsing from the clubs now infamous speakers. It was through Tic that he met Sampha one of the key collaborators on the album and one half of the SBTRKT live show. Alongside Sampha, Roses Gabor and Jessie Ware, the album track 'Wildfire' features Little Dragon and the imitable voice of Yukimi Nagano. \"I'm a big fan of their musical ethos so to collaborate with them has been an ambition for a while. It has been really interesting seeing how our two worlds could co-exist.Through the years, and his development as an artist and producer in his own right, SBTRKT has worked with collaborators both sonic and visual to emphasise his ideas and vision. The performance and visual style has also become an essential part of this setup. Performing in his trademark tribal mask, watching SBTRKT translate his sound live is opposed to what one would expect from the traditional producer / DJ. \"The live show is an expansion of what has been created in the studio and the tools I've used to make them. Just because a song has been created with a laptop, it doesn't mean that is the best way to perform it live, but for me, neither is bringing in a 5 piece band to re-interpret your songs. I see live shows in a very different light to producing in a studio as it's about translating into a medium for performance. The basic setup is myself on an acoustic drum kit with extra electronic triggers, and Sampha on 2 keyboards and vocals.... although it's constantly developing whilst we learn new ways to perform songs and experiment with new ways to route our live audio.\"Speaking about his mask, he explains \"...it reflects that in worldwide tribal societies that wearing a specific mask would evoke the spirit of an ancestor or animal, and is prominently used in ceremony and celebration. It\u2019s about uplifting the soul and challenging the normality of electronic music and production.\u201dSBTRKT's d\u00e9but album pulls off a series of impressive feats: it's bursting with fresh ideas, and yet it sounds immediately familiar. It's sound-patterns and rhythms can easily soundtrack the ecstatic hands in the air dance floor moments as well as reliving the monotony of the morning commute. It's influences are incorporated with subtlety and sophistication: dense enough to interpret, light enough to dance to.Support from DisclosureOver 14s only.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPrices\u00a311.00 (booking fees may apply)\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Wed 22 Feb 2012 \r\n           \r\n        Notes\r\n          Doors open at 7pm.\r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

They will be joined by two very special guests: kings of Seventies R & B disco Tavares and seminal sixties girl band The Crystals.  Tickets priced \u00a340 go on sale Friday 9th September at 9am.With Soul and R&B enjoying a dazzling comeback, this tour promises to get three or four generations together, shaking their hips and singing along to the timeless sound of some truly irresistible classics.  A few titles? \u201cReach Out (I\u2019ll be there)\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s All In The Game\u201d from the Four Tops; \u201cMy Girl\u201d and \u201cPapa Was a Rollin\u2019 Stone\u201d from The Temptations; \u201cHeaven Must Be Missing An Angel\u201d and \u201cMore Than A Woman\u201d from Tavares and \u201cDa Doo Ron Ron\u201d and \u201cThen He Kissed Me\u201d from The Crystals.  And these are likely to be just the encores after an endless string of unforgettable hits.Being the only ones choosing a baritone over a tenor in Stubbs, The Four Tops managed to stick out from the rest of the Motown roster. Originally from Detroit, Michigan, they moved to LA in the early Seventies and continued playing with no change in their line up until 1997, when Lawrence Payton passed away. The current line up includes original founder member Abdul \u201cDuke\u201d Fakir.Also from Detroit were The Temptations, one of Motown\u2019s most influential and successful recording artists; across five decades, they\u2019ve sold tens of millions of albums, spacing from R & B to funk, disco, soul and even adult contemporary music.  Founder and original member Otis Williams is still currently in the band, carrying its important legacy.The Tavares brothers started performing together when the youngest was only 9 years old, to become one of the most successful R & B, funk and soul names in the Seventies, although often seen as more of a disco act.  Their 1976\u2019 album \u201cSky High!\u201d produced 3 UK Top Ten singles, while the following year their version of \u201cMore Than a Woman\u201d for the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack won them a Grammy Award. 60s influential girl group The Crystals completes this unique bill for a trip down Memory Lane all the way to the modern rediscovery of everything vintage and soulful. The Crystals have managed to produce a long series of hits and are considered one of the defining female acts of their time. \u201cHe\u2019s a Rebel\u201d, written by Gene Pitney and produced by Phil Spector, became an all time classic and is the song that best represents Spector\u2019s girl group sound. Tickets for the Four Tops and The Temptations with special guests Tavares & The Crystals. Priced \u00a340 (bookng fe may apply) go on sale Friday 9th September, available in person at the Arena box office, by phone on 0114 256 5656 and online at www.motorpointarenasheffield.co.uk .A show for singles, couples, families and music lovers of all types and ages that will make you dance, sing, laugh and cry from the bottom of your very soul.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPrices\u00a340.00\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Fri 16 Mar 2012 \r\n          19:30 \r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

Recorded at Morwellham Quay in Devon, Seth has not only written, sung and played all the instruments on every track on the new album but he\u2019s also recorded and mixed the whole album himself. Seth says he has enjoyed this recording project like no other. \"I've been really keen for some time to get right back to the basics of \u2018Kitty Jay'..\" (the \u00a3300 kitchen-table album that shot him to fame and won him a Mercury Music Prize nomination back in 2005).\"To be blunt, this is the type of album I could never have done with a major label. I'm grateful for having worked in some of the best-equipped studios and with top producers, but with this record I've felt completely free to do my own thing for the first time in years.\u201d In keeping with this independent spirit, \u2018Tales from the Barrel House\u2019 has been released through his own Honour Oak Records, and is only available to buy from Seth\u2019s website as a strictly limited deluxe digipak with each copy individually numbered.\u2018Tales From The Barrel House\u2019 underlines Seth\u2019s innate knack for writing both foot-stomping, sing-along songs and more tender, thoughtful ballads. His playing is often breathtaking and Seth's trademark, soaring vocals are at the forefront of this album, as beguiling and haunting as ever. Charismatic, full of passionate energy and giving voice to people from the past, \"Tales from the Barrel House\" will entrance and enthral a growing army of present-day fans and, undoubtedly, will also be discovered by lovers of heartfelt music \u2013 discerning folk \u2013 of the future.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPrices\u00a318.00 (booking fees may apply)\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Thu 22 Mar 2012 \r\n           \r\n        Notes\r\n          Doors open at 7pm.\r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

From early works, such as the Flying Dutchman, Wagner developed a philosophy of music and pioneering harmonic and instrumental palette that influenced none other than the young Richard Strauss and Edward Elgar. To sing Strauss\u2019 sublime Four Last Songs, the Sheffield Symphony welcomes up-and-coming Irish soprano, Laura Sheerin, to realise the work\u2019s myriad colours and emotions. Britain\u2019s answer to Strauss, Elgar also incorporated Wagner\u2019s innovations into his own uniquely British voice.

The elaborate 3CD & 2DVD \u201cThe Santo Spirito Project\u201d will include a brand new studio album and 2 bespoke feature films on DVD, written and directed by Chris. The first feature is a raw and brutally honest chronicle on bullfighting and features neo-classical & Spanish themed gypsy music & the second feature follows a man through the city of Florence in his search for the truth, on a journey which he may or may not wish he began. The package will retail at the normal price of a CD album.The music to accompany both special feature films will be contained on 2CDs and Chris explains his rationale for such an ambitious project: \u201cI love creating things and passionately believe we (the artists) should be looking to try new ways of bringing what we do to the public. There should be no rules whatsoever and, for God\u2019s sake, there are alternatives to TV talent shows. Sometimes, those who have had extremely good fortune in music allow only X Factor type TV shows etc. to set the musical and cultural agenda of this county by actually doing nothing new or different themselves.\u201dChris\u2019s career spans over thirty years and both \u201cThe Road To Hell\u201d in 1989 and \u201cAuberge\u201d in 1991 debuted at No.1 in the UK, cementing his position as arguably one of the country\u2019s finest musicians and songwriters.His rich catalogue includes such classic songs as \u201cFool (If You Think It's Over)\u201d, \u201cOn The Beach\u201d, \u201cLet's Dance\u201d, \u201cJosephine\u201d, \u201cStainsby Girls\u201d and \u201cI Can Hear Your Heartbeat\u201d, \u201cWorking On It\u201d, \u201cThe Road To Hell (Part 2)\u201d, \u201cAuberge\u201d, \u201cGod\u2019s Great Banana Skin\u201d and \u201cJulia\u201d.The Santo Spirito Project will be released by Rhino UK, a division of Warner Music, on Monday September 5th on CD/DVD only at no more than the price of a normal CD single album and will not be available for digital download until December 2011.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPrices\u00a333.50\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Mon 26 Mar 2012 \r\n          19:30 \r\n        Notes\r\n          Doors open at 6.30pm.\r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",

JOHN RENBOURNJohn Renbourn was a founding member, along with Bert Jansch and Danny Thompson,  of  the 60\u2019s band Pentangle, an awesome fusion, which burst traditional categories thoroughly, but so tastefully, that protagonists in the traditional versus contemporary dogfight were shamed into contrition.John is a musician and guitarist, of an exceptional kind, combining an insight into the techniques of musical structure with an instrumental command and a sense of aesthetic adventurism, which together make him one of the most refreshing, not to say skilled and tasteful guitarists, to grace our ears today.Currently, aside from his touring with Williamson, John tours the World regularly both as a solo artist,  and with fellow musicians.  He has recently recorded and released a new album, Palermo Snow, which has been received with rave reviews around the World.A John Renbourn concert takes the listener into a rich musical landscape of warm vocals and witty asides about the history of the songs. At the core is a revolutionary guitar style that explores the instrument's potential in unusual and beautiful ways, created and performed by a consummate master.ROBIN WILLIAMSONThough best renowned as a founding member of The Incredible String Band, it's hard to think of anyone else on the contemporary music scene who can demonstrate such a dizzying range of accomplishments.

Having sold over 44 million records worldwide, the aforementioned 14 number one singles and 7 number one albums, Irish super-group Westlife are celebrating over 14 years of success by also releasing their brand new single \u2018Lighthouse\u2019 on November 13th (physically 14th) with the release of their \u2018Greatest Hits\u2019 on November 21st.  The single written by Gary Barlow and John Shanks is an instantly recognisable Westlife classic complete with soaring melodies, rousing lyrics and is one of four brand new tracks to feature on their album. With two Brits, an MTV Award, a World Music Award, no less than four Record of The Years under their belt and an incredible back catalogue spanning well over a decade not many artists can compare to Westlife\u2019s extraordinary success. In the UK alone they have earned the title of Biggest Selling International Band this Decade, scoring 10 multi platinum albums, the third highest number one single record in UK history (with only Elvis Presley and The Beatles ahead) and they also hold the crown for the Biggest Arena Act of All Time in the UK performing a record of 25 concerts at Wembley Arena.The band said: \u201cIt\u2019s almost hard to believe that we\u2019ve been doing this for as long as we have.

The journey from the darkness of death to the ultimate redemption is as compelling a journey as any and one that the Sheffield Symphony takes great pride in presenting to end its season.

Mark, Tom & Travis have this message for their fans: \u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we have to announce our planned 2011 European Summer tour has been rescheduled.  When we booked the tour last year, we were confident that we would have the new album out before the summer. Turns out we were mistaken as the album is taking longer than we thought and won't be out till later this year.  We hoped we would have some new songs to play rather than do another 'greatest hits tour' which you all saw last summer.  As much as we know our fans would be cool with that, we feel that we owe you guys something new when you spend your money to come see us. Frankly, it's what needs to continue for us to remain vital.  The three of us are working very hard to do what we set out to do when we re-formed: get a new Blink 182 album recorded.  Apologies to all of our fans who have bought tickets and were looking forward to the summer shows but we'll be back soon with the rescheduled dates in summer 2012, have a new album out and be able to play new songs for you all. Thanks for all of the continued support and understanding.\u201d Customers are being contacted and informed original tickets purchased for Thursday 7th July 2011 are now valid for Sunday 17th June 2012 and do not need to be exchanged. Should customers have any questions they are asked to contact the Arena Box Office on 0114 256 5656. Blink 182 were formed in San Diego in 1992 by Mark Hoppus and Tom De Longe and later joined by drummer Travis Barker. The bands breakthrough album, \u201cEnema Of The State\u201d, was released in 1999 and went on to sell in excess of 15 million copies worldwide. Their next two albums, \u201cTake Off Your Pants And Jacket\u201d (2001) and \u201cBlink 182\u201d (2003) cemented their position as a pop-punk super group. Additionally the band has won a number of MTV Awards throughout their career. Tickets for their rescheduled show at the Motorpoint Arena Sheffield on Sunday 17th June 2012 are available now.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tkey\r\n\t\tPrices\u00a333.19\r\nEvent details\tDates and Times\r\n        Dates\r\n         Times\r\n        Sun 17 Jun 2012 \r\n          19:30 \r\n        \u00a0\r\n          \u00a0\r\n     ",
